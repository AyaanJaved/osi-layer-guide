# The OSI Model: A Practical Guide

This repository is a hands-on guide to understanding the OSI model, designed to take you from abstract theory to tangible, working examples.

### What is This Project?

The goal of this project is to demystify network communication by breaking down each of the seven layers of the OSI model. Instead of just reading about what each layer does, you'll see it in action. This guide combines clear, concise articles with practical simulations and code examples that you can build and run yourself.

### The "Hands-On" Philosophy

Networking concepts can feel incredibly abstract. What does it *really* mean to "convert bits into a signal"? How does a router "choose the best path"?

This guide is built on the belief that the best way to understand these concepts is to build them. We will use tools like Tinkerad to create live, working hardware simulations and write simple Python scripts to model the logic of each layer. By doing this, we can make the invisible processes of the internet visible and understandable.

We will do this all while questioning our own assumptions, trying to genuinely grasp the invisible magic we take for granted every day, one layer and one simulation at a time.
